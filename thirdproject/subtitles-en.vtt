1
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.585
I will provide you some files

2
00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:09.200
and if you did the
optional set of video,

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.080
you've already had those
files up and ready to go.

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.120
If you decided to skip
that, that's fine.

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.860
You can use the provided files.

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.220
You should get this zipped file

7
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.290
for the font test files here.

8
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.365
On Windows don't forget
that you have to unzip it.

9
00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:27.480
Windows will make
it look like you

10
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.240
can access it by
double-clicking it,

11
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.220
but it won't actually
work properly.

12
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.500
You have to actually unzip
it by right-clicking and

13
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.130
choosing Extract All.
I have to do that.

14
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.050
On the Mac, all you have to
do is double-click it and it

15
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.500
will automatically
unzip, which is great.

16
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.130
Once I've zipped that,

17
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.710
I can throw this trash the
zip file in the trash and I'm

18
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.850
working with this one
and you can open up

19
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.970
these files in your code editor

20
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.770
and work with them
if you want to.

21
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.090
Alternatively, what I'm going

22
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.210
to be doing is I'm going to be

23
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.610
working with those same files
inside my website here,

24
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.360
this font test folder here
so as to not get confused.

25
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.130
I'm going to throw this folder

26
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.590
away because I'm just not

27
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.470
going to be using that
one for right now.

28
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.430
I'm going to use them
inside this folder but you

29
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.180
can work on it locally on
your desktop if you want.

30
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.635
Let's talk about
fonts on the web.

31
00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:30.310
Generally speaking, when
you create a website and

32
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.290
you use some styles to add
some fonts to your page,

33
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.770
then the fonts are going
to get loaded from

34
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.490
the local computer
that you're working

35
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.950
on or that somebody is
viewing your website from.

36
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.270
If somebody comes
to your website,

37
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.140
it's going to say use
whichever font you've

38
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.850
chosen and if it's on

39
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.130
that local computer,
it will display it.

40
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.690
If that font is not on
that local computer,

41
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.080
the local computer will
substitute a different font.

42
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.150
Because of that, we've

43
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.850
had a limited set of
fonts that we can

44
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.130
reliably be fairly certain
are on most computers.

45
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.595
These fonts include
Aerial, Verdana,

46
00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:20.730
Georgia, Times New Roman,

47
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.525
Courier, maybe a few others.

48
00:02:24.525 --> 00:02:27.390
There's very few.
For a long time,

49
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.410
we were really limited to
the fonts that we could use.

50
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.970
In the previous videos,

51
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.570
we talked about the
font-face CSS module,

52
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.790
which allows us to

53
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.870
download and use fonts

54
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.130
locally on the computer
from the Internet,

55
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.875
which is super useful.

56
00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:49.660
In this lesson, we'll be looking

57
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.390
at how to actually do that.

58
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.790
To get started with this,

59
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.540
we need a font that we can use.

60
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.780
We're going to use this
Freight Round font

61
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.670
and this is another
file that I will

62
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.950
provide for you that
you can work with.

63
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.390
This typeface was created by

64
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.630
a friend and colleague of
mine named Robbie Woodard.

65
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.110
He owns the font
and I asked him,

66
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.310
could I use this
font in my lessons

67
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.150
to teach people about

68
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.270
creating web fonts and
working with web fonts,

69
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.415
and he gave me
permission to do that.

70
00:03:30.415 --> 00:03:33.610
I have permission from
the person who owns

71
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.050
the fonts to do this
with you and for

72
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.090
you to use these fonts and to
work with them in this way.

73
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.730
It's important to mention that

74
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.345
because fonts are
licensed generally.

75
00:03:46.345 --> 00:03:49.150
When you purchase a font,

76
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.910
when you get a font
from somewhere,

77
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.910
you're getting a
license to use it.

78
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.870
You're not actually
buying the font.

79
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.170
You're buying the
license to use it.

80
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.610
Those licenses can
come with restrictions

81
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.990
about where and when and
how that font can be used.

82
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.410
Because I know the creator

83
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.170
of this font and he
gave us permission,

84
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.370
we're okay to do this with
this particular font,

85
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.610
but depending on where
you get your fonts,

86
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.250
you may or may not have

87
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.890
the license in order to
be able to use them.

88
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.990
I'm going to provide you with
these files for this font

89
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.520
and you'll see here if
I unzip the font again,

90
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.660
I'm going to Extract All.

91
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.240
Once again I've got a folder

92
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.890
here for macOS. I don't need.

93
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.750
I can just trash that.

94
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.560
But these are OTF files.

95
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.775
OTF stands for OpenType format.

96
00:04:49.775 --> 00:04:55.700
The OpenType format became
popular in the early 2000s,

97
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.420
and it has a lot of

98
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.275
potential glyphs inside
of an OpenType format.

99
00:05:00.275 --> 00:05:03.460
Plus it's cross-platform
for both Mac and Windows.

100
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.055
If I were to double click
on these typefaces,

101
00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:10.920
you would see I'd be able
to add them right into

102
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.950
the system for this computer
and I could use them in

103
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.770
Microsoft Word or
whatever applications

104
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.230
where I can select fonts.

105
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.570
I'd be able to use
these fonts here.

106
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.610
That's really cool
that you can do that.

107
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.090
The other popular format
for fonts is TTF,

108
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.780
which is TrueType fonts.

109
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.070
TrueType was originally
developed by Apple in order

110
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.590
to get around Adobe
licensing and

111
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.650
that's oversimplifying it but
essentially Apple created

112
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.380
their own formats so they
could distribute fonts on

113
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.965
their computers and Windows
can follow suit with TTF,

114
00:05:57.965 --> 00:05:59.860
but the OpenType format is

115
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:05.560
the newer format and it's
really nice for fonts.
